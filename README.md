#üè† Predicting Home Prices Using the Ames Housing Dataset

This project uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to predict home prices in Ames, Iowa based on historical data from Kaggle's Ames Housing Dataset. We aim to predict a target house's price based on the similarity to other houses.

## üìä Dataset
- **Source**: Kaggle's Ames Housing Dataset
- **Size**: 2,919 observations and 79 features
- **Features**: Information about house size, quality, area, age, and other attributes related to housing prices in Ames, Iowa.

## üîÑ Project Overview
This project involves the following steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Loaded the dataset as a Pandas DataFrame.
   - Cleaned and handled missing values.
   - Performed exploratory data analysis to understand key features.
   
2. **Key Feature Analysis**:
   - Analyzed the relationship between important features like `OverallQual`, `YearBuilt`, `TotalBsmtSF`, `GrLivArea`, and `SalePrice`.
   - Performed correlation analysis and generated descriptive statistics.

### Distribution: For each of the 5 features, generate a histogram. Choose the number of bins properly.
'''python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

selected_columns = ['OverallQual', 'YearBuilt', 'TotalBsmtSF', 'GrLivArea', 'SalePrice']

for column in selected_columns:
    plt.figure(figsize=(5, 4))
    plt.hist(df[column], bins=15, color='blue', edgecolor='skyblue')
    plt.title(f'Histogram of {column}')
    plt.xlabel(column)
    plt.ylabel('Frequency')
    plt.grid(axis='y', linestyle='--', alpha=0.5)
    plt.show()
'''

### Correlation with sale price: For each of the 4 chosen predictive features, draw a scatter plot of this feature and SalePrice. Set the title, axis label of the graph properly
'''python
selected_features = ['OverallQual', 'YearBuilt', 'TotalBsmtSF', 'GrLivArea']
target_feature = 'SalePrice'
correlation_matrix = data.corr()

for feature in selected_features:
    plt.figure(figsize=(4, 3))
    plt.scatter(df[feature], df[target_feature], alpha=0.7, color='skyblue')
    plt.title(f'Scatter Plot of {feature} vs. {target_feature}')
    plt.xlabel(feature)
    plt.ylabel(target_feature)
    plt.grid(True, linestyle='--', alpha=0.7)
    plt.show()
'''

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Created new features such as `TotalArea` (sum of basement area and ground living area) and `AreaPerRoom` (average room size).
   
4. **Modeling**:
   - Implemented the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to estimate housing prices.
   - Predicted the price of a new house (test dataset) by comparing it to 5 similar houses based on Euclidean distance.
   
5. **Results**:
   - Predicted price for the target house was **$121,080**.
   - Used the average price of the 5 nearest neighbors to generate the prediction.
   - Prices of the 5 nearest neighbors:
$122,000
$125,500
$109,900
$109,500
$138,500

## üéØ Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to use machine learning techniques like K-Nearest Neighbors for regression tasks such as predicting housing prices. The preprocessing and feature engineering steps are crucial for improving model performance, and this project can be further extended by experimenting with more advanced algorithms like XGBoost or Random Forest.

Developed a machine learning model to predict hospital readmission likelihood, aiming to improve hospital operational efficiency and patient care management.
-	Developed and deployed a machine learning model to predict hospital readmission, achieving an AUC score of 0.68 on the final test dataset.
-	Preprocessed and cleaned a real-world dataset of over 8,000 hospital entries and 40 features (e.g., diagnoses, prescriptions, ER visits).
-	Implemented Logistic Regression and XGBoost models with hyperparameter tuning, increasing predictive performance by ~7% using model stacking with TF-IDF for medical text data.
